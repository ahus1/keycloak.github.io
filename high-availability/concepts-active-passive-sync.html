<p>This topic describes a highly available active/passive setup and the behavior to expect. It outlines the requirements of the high availability active/passive architecture and describes the benefits and tradeoffs.</p>

<h2 id="_when_to_use_this_setup">When to use this setup</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use this setup to be able to fail over automatically in the event of a site failure, which reduces the likelihood of losing data or sessions. Manual interactions are usually required to restore the redundancy after the failover.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_deployment_data_storage_and_caching">Deployment, data storage and caching</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two independent Keycloak deployments running in different sites are connected with a low latency network connection.
Users, realms, clients, offline sessions, and other entities are stored in a database that is replicated synchronously across the two sites.
The data is also cached in the Keycloak embedded Infinispan as local caches.
When the data is changed in one Keycloak instance, that data is updated in the database, and an invalidation message is sent to the other site using the replicated <code>work</code> cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Session-related data is stored in the replicated caches of the embedded Infinispan of Keycloak, and forwarded to the external Infinispan, which forwards information to the external Infinispan running synchronously in the other site.
As session data of the external Infinispan is also cached in the embedded Infinispan, invalidation messages of the replicated <code>work</code> cache are needed for invalidation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following paragraphs and diagrams, references to deploying Infinispan apply to the external Infinispan.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this setup aims for high availability, the following situations can still lead to service or data loss:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network failures between the sites or failures of components can lead to short service downtimes while those failures are detected.
The service will be restored automatically.
The system is degraded until the failures are detected and the backup cluster is promoted to service requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once failures occur in the communication between the sites, manual steps are necessary to re-synchronize a degraded setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Degraded setups can lead to service or data loss if additional components fail.
Monitoring is necessary to detect degraded setups.</p>

<h2 id="_questions_and_answers">Questions and answers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Why synchronous database replication?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A synchronously replicated database ensures that data written in the primary site is always available in the secondary site on failover and no data is lost.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Why synchronous Infinispan replication?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A synchronously replicated Infinispan ensures that sessions created, updated and deleted in the primary site are always available in the secondary site on failover and no data is lost.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Why is a low-latency network between sites needed?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Synchronous replication defers the response to the caller until the data is received at the secondary site.
For synchronous database replication and synchronous Infinispan replication, a low latency is necessary as each request can have potentially multiple interactions between the sites when data is updated which would amplify the latency.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Why active-passive?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some databases support a single writer instance with a reader instance which is then promoted to be the new writer once the original writer fails.
In such a setup, it is beneficial for the latency to have the writer instance in the same site as the currently active Keycloak.
Synchronous Infinispan replication can lead to deadlocks when entries in both sites are modified concurrently.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Is this setup limited to two sites?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This setup could be extended to multiple sites, and there are no fundamental changes necessary to have, for example, three sites.
Once more sites are added, the overall latency between the sites increases, and the likeliness of network failures, and therefore short downtimes, increases as well.
Therefore, such a deployment is expected to have worse performance and an inferior.
For now, it has been tested and documented with blueprints only for two sites.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Is a synchronous cluster less stable than an asynchronous cluster?</dt>
<dd>
<p>An asynchronous setup would handle network failures between the sites gracefully, while the synchronous setup would delay requests and will throw errors to the caller where the asynchronous setup would have deferred the writes to Infinispan or the database to the secondary site.
However, as the secondary site would never be fully up-to-date with the primary site, this setup could lead to data loss during failover.
This would include:</p>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lost logouts, meaning sessions are logged in the secondary site although they are logged out in to the primary site at the point of failover when using an asynchronous Infinispan replication of sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lost changes leading to users being able to log in with an old password because database changes are not replicated to the secondary site at the point of failover when using an asynchronous database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid caches leading to users being able to log in with an old password because invalidating caches are not propagated at the point of failover to the secondary site when using an asynchronous Infinispan replication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, tradeoffs exist between high availability and consistency. The focus of this topic is to prioritize consistency over availability with Keycloak.</p>
